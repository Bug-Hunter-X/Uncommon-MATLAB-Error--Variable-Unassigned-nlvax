This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error involving using a variable before it's properly assigned a value within a function's scope. The 'bug.m' file contains the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.m' provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to use a variable before a value has been assigned.  Understanding how MATLAB handles variable scoping and assignment is crucial for avoiding this issue. The solution highlights proper variable initialization to prevent this error. This issue can be particularly troublesome when dealing with conditional logic or nested functions, causing unexpected and hard-to-debug results.
